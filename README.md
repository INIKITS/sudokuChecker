# sudokuChecker
This will take in a sudoku grid as an array and check if it is a valid puzzle, if the answers are correct, and you can check to see if two puzzles are the same.

# notes 
I learned a lot about nested functions and how to use arrays in different ways during this project. The biggest challenge was trying to figure out the getSection portion of the functions. I was really close to solving, but ended up using Ryan's code to finish. I think in the future given a similar task, I will be better prepared to solve on my own.
